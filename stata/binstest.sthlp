{title:Description}

{p 4 8} {cmd:binstest} implements binscatter-based hypothesis testing procedures for parametric functional forms of
and nonparametric shape restrictions on the regression function estimators, following the results in
{browse "https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2024_AER.pdf":Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024a)} and
{browse "https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2024_NonlinearBinscatter.pdf":Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024b)}.
If the binning scheme is not set by the user, the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect} is used
to implement binscatter in a data-driven (optimal) way and inference procedures are based on robust bias correction.
Binned scatter plots based on different models can be constructed using the companion commands {help binsreg:binsreg},
{help binsqreg: binsqreg}, {help binslogit:binslogit} and {help binsprobit:binsprobit}.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} A detailed introduction to this command is given in
{browse "https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2024_Stata.pdf":Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024c)}.
Companion R and Python packages with the same capabilities are available (see website below).
{p_end}

{p 4 8} Companion commands: {help binsreg:binsreg} for binscatter regression with robust inference procedures and plots,
{help binsqreg:binsqreg} for binscatter quantile regression with robust inference procedures and plots,
{help binslogit:binslogit} for binscatter logit estimation with robust inference procedures and plots,
{help binsprobit:binsprobit} for binscatter probit estimation with robust inference procedures and plots,
and {help binsregselect:binsregselect} for data-driven (optimal) binning selection.{p_end}

{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt testmodelparfit(filename)} specifies a dataset which contains the evaluation grid and fitted values of the model(s) to be tested against.
The file must have a variable with the same name as {it:indvar}, which contains a series of evaluation points at which
the binscatter model and the parametric model of interest are compared with each other.
Each parametric model is represented by a variable named as {it:binsreg_fit*}, which must contain the fitted values at the corresponding evaluation points.
{p_end}

{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt testshape2(numlist)} specifies a {help numlist} of null boundary values for hypothesis testing.
Each number {it:a} in the {it:numlist} corresponds to one boundary of a two-sided hypothesis test of the
form H0: {it:sup_x |mu(x)-a|=0}.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Metric for Hypothesis Testing}

{p 4 8} {opt lp(metric)} specifies an Lp metric used for parametric model specification testing and/or shape restriction testing.
The default is {cmd:lp(inf)}, which corresponds to the sup-norm.

{p_end}
 
{dlgtab:Binning/Degree/Smoothness Selection}

{p 4 8} {opt bins(p s)} sets a piecewise polynomial of degree {it:p} with {it:s} smoothness constraints for
data-driven (IMSE-optimal) selection of the partitioning/binning scheme.
The default is {cmd:bins(0 0)}, which corresponds to the piecewise constant.

{p 4 8} {opt nbins(nbinsopt)} sets the number of bins for partitioning/binning of {it:indvar}. 
If {cmd:nbins(T)} or {cmd:nbins()} (default) is specified, the number of bins is selected via the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect} 
in a data-driven, optimal way whenever possible. If a {help numlist:numlist} with more than one number is specified, 
the number of bins is selected within this list via the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect}.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt binspos(position)} specifies the position of binning knots.
The default is {cmd:binspos(qs)}, which corresponds to quantile-spaced binning (canonical binscatter).
Other options are: {cmd:es} for evenly-spaced binning, or a {help numlist} for manual specification of the positions
of inner knots (which must be within the range of {it:indvar}).
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt binsmethod(method)} specifies the method for data-driven selection of the number of bins via
the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect}.

If not specified, the data-driven ROT selector is used instead.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt randcut(#)} specifies the upper bound on a uniformly distributed variable used to draw a subsample 
for bins/degree/smoothness selection.
Observations for which {cmd:runiform()<=#} are used. # must be between 0 and 1. 
By default, max(5000, 0.01n) observations are used if the samples size n>5000.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt pselect(numlist)} specifies a list of numbers within which the degree of polynomial {it:p} for 
point estimation is selected. If the selected optimal degree is {it:p}, then piecewise polynomials 
of degree {it:p+1} are used to conduct testing 
for nonparametric shape restrictions or parametric model specifications.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt sselect(numlist)} specifies a list of numbers within which the number of smoothness constraints {it:s}
for point estimation.  If the selected optimal smoothness is {it:s}, 
then piecewise polynomials with {it:s+1} smoothness constraints are used to conduct testing 
for nonparametric shape restrictions or parametric model specifications.
If not specified, for each value {it:p} supplied in the 
option {cmd:pselect()}, only the piecewise polynomial with the maximum smoothness is considered, i.e., {it:s=p}. 
{p_end}

{p 4 8} Note: To implement the degree or smoothness selection, in addition to {cmd:pselect()} 
or {cmd:sselect()}, {cmd:nbins(#)} must be specified.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Simulation}

{p 4 8} {opt nsims(#)} specifies the number of random draws for hypothesis testing.
The default is {cmd:nsims(500)}, which corresponds to 500 draws from a standard Gaussian random vector of size [(p+1)*J - (J-1)*s].
Setting at least {cmd:nsims(2000)} is recommended to obtain the final results.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt simsgrid(#)} specifies the number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used
for evaluation of the supremum (infimum or Lp metric) operation needed for hypothesis testing procedures.
The default is {cmd:simsgrid(20)}, which corresponds to 20 evenly-spaced evaluation points within
each bin for approximating the supremum (infimum or Lp metric) operator.
Setting at least {cmd:simsgrid(50)} is recommended to obtain the final results.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt simsseed(#)} sets the seed for simulations.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Mass Points and Degrees of Freedom}

{p 4 8} {opt dfcheck(n1 n2)} sets cutoff values for minimum effective sample size checks, which take into account the number of unique values of {it:indvar}
(i.e., adjusting for the number of mass points), number of clusters, and degrees of freedom of the different statistical models considered.
The default is {cmd:dfcheck(20 30)}. See Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024c) for more details.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt masspoints(masspointsoption)} specifies how mass points in {it:indvar} are handled.
By default, all mass point and degrees of freedom checks are implemented.
Available options:
{p_end}
{p 8 8} {opt masspoints(noadjust)} omits mass point checks and the corresponding effective sample size adjustments.{p_end}
{p 8 8} {opt masspoints(nolocalcheck)} omits within-bin mass point and degrees of freedom checks.{p_end}
{p 8 8} {opt masspoints(off)} sets {opt masspoints(noadjust)} and {opt masspoints(nolocalcheck)} simultaneously.{p_end}
{p 8 8} {opt masspoints(veryfew)} forces the command to proceed as if {it:indvar} has only a few number of mass points (i.e., distinct values).
In other words, forces the command to proceed as if the mass point and degrees of freedom checks were failed.{p_end}

{dlgtab:Other Options}

{p 4 8} {cmd:vce(}{it:{help vcetype}}{cmd:)} specifies the {it:vcetype} for variance estimation used by the commands {help regress##options:regress},

{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt asyvar(on/off)} specifies the method used to compute standard errors.
If {cmd:asyvar(on)} is specified, the standard error of the nonparametric component is used and the
uncertainty related to other control variables {it:othercovs} is omitted. Default is {cmd:asyvar(off)},
that is, the uncertainty related to {it:othercovs} is taken into account.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt estmethodopt(cmd_option)} options to be passed on to the estimation command specified in {cmd:estmethod()}.
For example, options that control for the optimization process can be added here.
