{title:Description}

{p 4 8} {cmd:binsprobit} implements binscatter probit estimation with robust inference procedures and plots, following the results in
{browse "https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2024_AER.pdf":Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024a)} and
{browse "https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2024_NonlinearBinscatter.pdf":Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024b)}.
Binscatter provides a flexible way to describe the mean relationship between two variables, after possibly adjusting for other covariates,
based on partitioning/binning of the independent variable of interest.
The main purpose of this command is to generate binned scatter plots with curve estimation with robust pointwise confidence intervals and uniform confidence band.
If the binning scheme is not set by the user, the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect} is used to implement binscatter in a data-driven way.
Hypothesis testing for parametric specifications of and shape restrictions on the regression function can be conducted via the
companion command {help binstest:binstest}. Hypothesis testing for pairwise group comparisons can be conducted via the
companion command {help binspwc: binspwc}. Binscatter estimation based on the least squares method can be conducted via the command {help binsreg: binsreg}.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} A detailed introduction to this command is given in
{browse "https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2024_Stata.pdf":Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024c)}.
Companion R and Python packages with the same capabilities are available (see website below).
{p_end}

{p 4 8} Companion commands: {help binstest:binstest} for hypothesis testing of parametric specifications and shape restrictions,
{help binspwc:binspwc} for hypothesis testing for pairwise group comparisons, and
{help binsregselect:binsregselect} for data-driven binning selection.{p_end}

{p 4 8} Related Stata, R and Python packages are available in the following website:{p_end}

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Estimand}

{p 4 8} {opt deriv(v)} specifies the derivative order of the regression function for estimation and plotting.
The default is {cmd:deriv(0)}, which corresponds to the function itself.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt at(position)} specifies the values of {it:othercovs} at which the estimated function is evaluated for plotting.
The default is {cmd:at(mean)}, which corresponds to the mean of {it:othercovs}. Other options are: {cmd:at(median)} for the median of {it:othercovs},
{cmd:at(0)} for zeros, and {cmd:at(filename)} for particular values of {it:othercovs} saved in another file.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} Note: When {cmd:at(mean)} or {cmd:at(median)} is specified, all factor variables in {it:othercovs} (if specified) are excluded from the evaluation (set as zero).
{p_end}

{p 4 8}{opt nolink} specifies that the function within the inverse link (logistic) function be reported instead of the conditional probability function.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Dots}

If {cmd:dots(p s)} is specified, a piecewise polynomial of degree {it:p} with {it:s} smoothness constraints is used.  
The default is {cmd:dots(0 0)}, which corresponds to piecewise constant (canonical binscatter). 
If {cmd:dots(T)} is specified, the default {cmd:dots(0 0)} is used unless the degree {it:p} or smoothness {it:s} selection
is requested via the option {cmd:pselect()} or {cmd:sselect()} (see more details in the explanation 
of {cmd:pselect()} and {cmd:sselect()}).  
If {cmd:dots(F)} is specified, the dots are not included in the plot.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt dotsgrid(dotsgridoption)} specifies the number and location of dots within each bin to be plotted.

The option {opt dotsgrid(#)} adds {it:#} number of evenly-spaced points to the grid of evaluation points for each bin.
Both options can be used simultaneously: for example, {opt dotsgrid(mean 5)} generates six evaluation points within each bin
containing the sample mean of {it:indvar} within each bin and five evenly-spaced points.
Given this choice, the dots are point estimates evaluated over the selected grid within each bin.
The default is {opt dotsgrid(mean)}, which corresponds to one dot per bin evaluated at
the sample average of {it:indvar} within each bin (canonical binscatter).
{p_end}

The option {opt cigrid(#)} adds {it:#} number of evenly-spaced points to the grid of evaluation points for each bin.
Both options can be used simultaneously: for example, {opt cigrid(mean 5)} generates six evaluation points within each bin
containing the sample mean of {it:indvar} within each bin and five evenly-spaced points.
The default is {opt cigrid(mean)}, which corresponds to one evaluation point set at
the sample average of {it:indvar} within each bin for confidence interval construction.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt ciplotopt(rcapoption)} standard graphs options to be passed on to the

{dlgtab:Binning/Degree/Smoothness Selection}

{p 4 8} {opt nbins(nbinsopt)} sets the number of bins for partitioning/binning of {it:indvar}. 
If {cmd:nbins(T)} or {cmd:nbins()} (default) is specified, the number of bins is selected via the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect} 
in a data-driven, optimal way whenever possible. If a {help numlist:numlist} with more than one number is specified, 
the number of bins is selected within this list via the companion command {help binsregselect:binsregselect}.

{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt pselect(numlist)} specifies a list of numbers within which the degree of polynomial {it:p} for 
point estimation is selected. Piecewise polynomials of the selected optimal degree {it:p} 
are used to construct dots or line if {cmd:dots(T)} or {cmd:line(T)} is specified, 
whereas piecewise polynomials of degree {it:p+1} are used to construct confidence intervals
or confidence band if {cmd:ci(T)} or {cmd:cb(T)} is specified.
{p_end}

{p 4 8} {opt sselect(numlist)} specifies a list of numbers within which 
the number of smoothness constraints {it:s}

{it:s} smoothness constraints are used to construct dots or line 
if {cmd:dots(T)} or {cmd:line(T)} is specified, 
whereas piecewise polynomials with {it:s+1} constraints are used to construct 
confidence intervals or confidence band if {cmd:ci(T)} or {cmd:cb(T)} is specified. 
If not specified, for each value {it:p} supplied in the 
option {cmd:pselect()}, only the piecewise polynomial with the maximum smoothness is considered, i.e., {it:s=p}. 
{p_end}

{p 4 8} Note: To implement the degree or smoothness selection, in addition to {cmd:pselect()} 
or {cmd:sselect()}, {cmd:nbins(#)} must be specified.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Simulation}

{p 4 8} {opt nsims(#)} specifies the number of random draws for constructing confidence bands.

within each bin used for evaluation of the supremum operation needed to construct confidence bands.
The default is {cmd:simsgrid(20)}, which corresponds to 20 evenly-spaced evaluation points
within each bin for approximating the supremum operator.
Setting at least {cmd:simsgrid(50)} is recommended to obtain the final results.
