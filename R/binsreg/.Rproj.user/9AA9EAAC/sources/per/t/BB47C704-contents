#'@title  Data-Driven Binscatter Quantile Regression with Robust Inference Procedures and Plots
#'@description \code{binsqreg} implements binscatter quantile regression with robust inference procedures and plots, following the
#'             results in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09608}{Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2021a)}.
#'             Binscatter provides a flexible way to describe the quantile relationship between two variables, after
#'             possibly adjusting for other covariates, based on partitioning/binning of the independent variable of interest.
#'             The main purpose of this function is to generate binned scatter plots with curve estimation with robust pointwise confidence intervals and
#'             uniform confidence band.  If the binning scheme is not set by the user, the companion function
#'             \code{\link{binsregselect}} is used to implement binscatter in a data-driven way. Hypothesis testing about the function of interest
#'             can be conducted via the companion function \code{\link{binstest}}.
#'@param  y outcome variable. A vector.
#'@param  x independent variable of interest. A vector.
#'@param  w control variables. A matrix, a vector or a \code{\link{formula}}.
#'@param  data an optional data frame containing variables in the model.
#'@param  at value of \code{w} at which the estimated function is evaluated.  The default is \code{at="mean"}, which corresponds to
#'           the mean of \code{w}. Other options are: \code{at="median"} for the median of \code{w}, \code{at="zero"} for a vector of zeros.
#'           \code{at} can also be a vector of the same length as the number of columns of \code{w} (if \code{w} is a matrix) or a data frame containing the same variables as specified in \code{w} (when
#'           \code{data} is specified). Note that when \code{at="mean"} or \code{at="median"}, all factor variables (if specified) are excluded from the evaluation (set as zero).
#'@param  quantile the quantile to be estimated. A number strictly between 0 and 1.
#'@param  deriv  derivative order of the regression function for estimation, testing and plotting.
#'               The default is \code{deriv=0}, which corresponds to the function itself.
#'@param  dots a vector or a logical value. If \code{dots=c(p,s)}, a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with
#'             \code{s} smoothness constraints is used for point estimation and plotting as "dots". If \code{dots=T}, the degree and smoothness of the polynomial
#'             are selected via the companion function \code{\link{binsregselect}}. If \code{dots=F}, dots are not included in the plot.
#'             The default is \code{dots=c(0,0)}, which corresponds to piecewise constant (canonical binscatter).
#'@param  dotsgrid number of dots within each bin to be plotted. Given the choice, these dots are point estimates
#'                 evaluated over an evenly-spaced grid within each bin. The default is \code{dotsgrid=0}, and only
#'                 the point estimates at the mean of \code{x} within each bin are presented.
#'@param  dotsgridmean If true, the dots corresponding to the point estimates evaluated at the mean of \code{x} within each bin
#'                     are presented. By default, they are presented, i.e., \code{dotsgridmean=T}.
#'@param  line a vector or a logical value. If \code{line=c(p,s)}, a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with \code{s} smoothness constraints
#'             is used for plotting as a "line". If \code{line=T}, the degree and smoothness of the polynomial
#'             are selected via the companion function \code{\link{binsregselect}}. If \code{line=F}, the line is not included in the plot.
#'             By default, the line is not included in the plot unless explicitly
#'             specified. Recommended specification is \code{line=c(3,3)}, which adds a cubic B-spline estimate
#'             of the regression function of interest to the binned scatter plot.
#'@param  linegrid number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of
#'                 the point estimate set by the \code{line=c(p,s)} option. The default is \code{linegrid=20},
#'                 which corresponds to 20 evenly-spaced evaluation points within each bin for fitting/plotting the line.
#'@param  ci a vector or a logical value. If \code{ci=c(p,s)} a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with \code{s} smoothness constraints is used for
#'             constructing confidence intervals. If \code{ci=T}, the degree \code{p} and smoothness \code{s} of the polynomial
#'             are selected via the companion function \code{\link{binsregselect}}, and a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p+1} and
#'             \code{s+1} smoothness constraints is used to construct confidence intervals.
#'             If \code{ci=F}, confidence intervals are not included in the plot.
#'             The default \code{ci=T}.
#'@param  cigrid number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of the point
#'               estimate set by the \code{ci=c(p,s)} option. The default is \code{cigrid=1}, which corresponds to 1
#'               evenly-spaced evaluation point within each bin for confidence interval construction.
#'@param  cigridmean If true, the confidence intervals corresponding to the point estimates evaluated at the mean of \code{x} within each bin
#'                   are presented. The default is \code{cigridmean=T}.
#'@param  cb a vector or a logical value. If \code{cb=c(p,s)}, a the piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with \code{s} smoothness constraints is used for
#'           constructing the confidence band. If \code{cb=T}, the degree \code{p} and smoothness \code{s} of the polynomial
#'             are selected via the companion function \code{\link{binsregselect}}, and a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p+1} and
#'             \code{s+1} smoothness constraints is used to construct confidence band.
#'             If \code{cb=F}, the confidence band is not included in the plot.
#'             The default \code{cb=T}.
#'@param  cbgrid number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of the point
#'               estimate set by the \code{cb=c(p,s)} option. The default is \code{cbgrid=20}, which corresponds
#'               to 20 evenly-spaced evaluation points within each bin for confidence interval construction.
#'@param  polyreg degree of a global polynomial regression model for plotting. By default, this fit is not included
#'                in the plot unless explicitly specified. Recommended specification is \code{polyreg=3}, which
#'                adds a cubic (global) polynomial fit of the regression function of interest to the binned scatter plot.
#'@param  polyreggrid number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of
#'                    the point estimate set by the \code{polyreg=p} option. The default is \code{polyreggrid=20},
#'                    which corresponds to 20 evenly-spaced evaluation points within each bin for confidence
#'                    interval construction.
#'@param  polyregcigrid number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for constructing
#'                      confidence intervals based on polynomial regression set by the \code{polyreg=p} option.
#'                      The default is \code{polyregcigrid=0}, which corresponds to not plotting confidence
#'                      intervals for the global polynomial regression approximation.
#'@param  by a vector containing the group indicator for subgroup analysis; both numeric and string variables
#'           are supported. When \code{by} is specified, \code{binsreg} implements estimation and inference for each subgroup
#'           separately, but produces a common binned scatter plot. By default, the binning structure is selected for each
#'           subgroup separately, but see the option \code{samebinsby} below for imposing a common binning structure across subgroups.
#'@param  bycolors an ordered list of colors for plotting each subgroup series defined by the option \code{by}.
#'@param  bysymbols an ordered list of symbols for plotting each subgroup series defined by the option \code{by}.
#'@param  bylpatterns an ordered list of line patterns for plotting each subgroup series defined by the option \code{by}.
#'@param  legendTitle String, title of legend.
#'@param  legendoff If true, no legend is added.
#'@param  nbins number of bins for partitioning/binning of \code{x}.  The default is \code{nbins=20}. If \code{nbins=T}, the number of bins is
#'              selected via the companion function \code{\link{binsregselect}} in a data-driven, optimal way whenever possible.
#'              If \code{nbins} is a vector with more than one element, the number of bins is selected within this vector via
#'              the companion function \code{\link{binsregselect}}.
#'@param  binspos position of binning knots. The default is \code{binspos="qs"}, which corresponds to quantile-spaced
#'                binning (canonical binscatter).  The other options are \code{"es"} for evenly-spaced binning, or
#'                a vector for manual specification of the positions of inner knots (which must be within the range of
#'                \code{x}).
#'@param  binsmethod method for data-driven selection of the number of bins. The default is \code{binsmethod="dpi"},
#'                   which corresponds to the IMSE-optimal direct plug-in rule.  The other option is: \code{"rot"}
#'                   for rule of thumb implementation.
#'@param  nbinsrot initial number of bins value used to construct the DPI number of bins selector.
#'                 If not specified, the data-driven ROT selector is used instead.
#'@param  pselect vector of numbers within which the degree of polynomial \code{p} for point estimation (dots, and lines) is selected.
#'                The default is \code{pselect=0:4}.
#'@param  sselect vector of numbers within which the number of smoothness constraints \code{s} for point estimation (dots, and lines) is selected.
#'                If not specified, for each value \code{p} supplied in the option \code{pselect}, only the
#'                piecewise polynomial with the maximum smoothness is considered, i.e., \code{s=p}.
#'@param  samebinsby if true, a common partitioning/binning structure across all subgroups specified by the option \code{by} is forced.
#'                   The knots positions are selected according to the option \code{binspos} and using the full sample. If \code{nbins}
#'                   is not specified, then the number of bins is selected via the companion command \code{\link{binsregselect}} and
#'                   using the full sample.
#'@param  randcut upper bound on a uniformly distributed variable used to draw a subsample for bins/degree/smoothness selection.
#'                Observations for which \code{runif()<=#} are used. # must be between 0 and 1. By default, roughly 1000 observations are used.
#'@param  nsims number of random draws for constructing confidence bands. The default is
#'              \code{nsims=500}, which corresponds to 500 draws from a standard Gaussian random vector of size
#'              \code{[(p+1)*J - (J-1)*s]}.
#'@param  simsgrid number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of
#'                 the supremum operation needed to construct confidence bands.
#'                 The default is \code{simsgrid=20}, which corresponds to 20 evenly-spaced
#'                 evaluation points within each bin for approximating the supremum operator.
#'@param  simsseed  seed for simulation.
#'@param  vce Procedure to compute the variance-covariance matrix estimator (see \code{\link{summary.rq}} for more details). Options are
#'           \itemize{
#'           \item \code{"iid"} which presumes that the errors are iid and computes an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix as in KB(1978).
#'           \item \code{"nid"} which presumes local (in quantile) linearity of the the conditional quantile functions and computes a Huber sandwich estimate using a local estimate of the sparsity.
#'           \item \code{"ker"} which uses a kernel estimate of the sandwich as proposed by Powell (1991).
#'           \item \code{"boot"} which implements one of several possible bootstrapping alternatives for estimating standard errors including a variate of the wild bootstrap for clustered response. See \code{\link{boot.rq}} for further details.
#'           }
#'@param  cluster cluster ID. Used for compute cluster-robust standard errors.
#'@param  asyvar  If true, the standard error of the nonparametric component is computed and the uncertainty related to control
#'                variables is omitted. Default is \code{asyvar=FALSE}, that is, the uncertainty related to control variables is taken into account.
#'@param  level nominal confidence level for confidence interval and confidence band estimation. Default is \code{level=95}.
#'@param  noplot If true, no plot produced.
#'@param  dfcheck adjustments for minimum effective sample size checks, which take into account number of unique
#'                values of \code{x} (i.e., number of mass points), number of clusters, and degrees of freedom of
#'                the different statistical models considered. The default is \code{dfcheck=c(20, 30)}.
#'                See \href{https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2021_Stata.pdf}{Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2021b)} for more details.
#'@param  masspoints how mass points in \code{x} are handled. Available options:
#'                   \itemize{
#'                   \item \code{"on"} all mass point and degrees of freedom checks are implemented. Default.
#'                   \item \code{"noadjust"} mass point checks and the corresponding effective sample size adjustments are omitted.
#'                   \item \code{"nolocalcheck"} within-bin mass point and degrees of freedom checks are omitted.
#'                   \item \code{"off"} "noadjust" and "nolocalcheck" are set simultaneously.
#'                   \item \code{"veryfew"} forces the function to proceed as if \code{x} has only a few number of mass points (i.e., distinct values).
#'                                          In other words, forces the function to proceed as if the mass point and degrees of freedom checks were failed.
#'                   }
#'@param  weights an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting process. Should be \code{NULL} or
